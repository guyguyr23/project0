          Vincent Willem van Gogh 30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890 was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. <br>In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.<br> They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.<br> He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness and poverty.
