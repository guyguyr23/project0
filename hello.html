          Vincent Willem van Gogh 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890 was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.<br> They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.< He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness and poverty.

            Despite being painted more than 130 years ago, this cafe still exists in France and has since been renamed the Café Van Gogh. This artwork marks the first time Van Gogh's famous post-impressionistic star-filled sky was seen in a piece,<br><br> and it’s believed the work was painted on the ground, in person, rather than from memory. While the artwork doesn't bear his signature,<br> it's widely known to be Van Gogh's, as he mentions Café Terrace at Night in a number of his letters.
